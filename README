Transparent Screenlock Program for Enterprise Linux

Useful in kiosk or operational environments.  Installations are configured with a list of groups that are permitted to unlock the screen on that computer, and logs document who unlocked the screen when.

Inspired by e-motional.com's Transparent Screen Lock Security software for Windows Systems.

Tested on EL6 and EL7.
